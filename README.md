ChatBot using PyTorch
📝 Overview
This project is a simple conversational chatbot built using PyTorch. It uses a pre-trained neural network to classify user input into predefined intents and provides appropriate responses. The chatbot processes text with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as tokenization, stemming, and the bag-of-words model.

✨ Features
Deep Learning: Powered by a multi-layer neural network implemented with PyTorch.
NLP Techniques: Processes user input using tokenization, stemming, and a bag-of-words approach.
Customizable Intents: Easily modify the chatbot’s responses by editing the intents.json file.
Real-time Interaction: Engage with the chatbot directly through the command line interface.

📋 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed to run the chatbot:

Python 3.x
PyTorch library
nltk library (for NLP tasks)
⚙️ Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/MMKCODE45/chatbot-pytorch.git
Install required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install torch nltk
Download NLTK data (if not already installed):
python
Copy code
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
🏋️‍♂️ Training the Model
Before interacting with the chatbot, you must train the model using the train.py script:

Customize intents.json: Add your own intents, patterns, and responses.
Run the training script:
bash
Copy code
python train.py
The model will be trained and the parameters will be saved in data.pth.
🤖 Running the Chatbot
Once the model is trained, interact with the chatbot using the chat.py script:

bash
Copy code
python chat.py
Type your questions and chat with the bot. To exit, simply type quit.

🗣 Example Conversation
vbnet
Copy code
You: Hi
Bot: Hello, how can I assist you?

You: What services do you provide?
Bot: I offer general customer support. How can I help you today?

You: quit
⚡ Customization
The chatbot's responses are driven by the intents.json file. Feel free to modify this file to change the chatbot’s behavior. Below is an example format:

Example intents.json
json
Copy code
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "tag": "greeting",
      "patterns": ["Hi", "Hey", "Hello"],
      "responses": ["Hello!", "Hi there!", "Hey! How can I help you?"]
    },
    {
      "tag": "goodbye",
      "patterns": ["Bye", "See you later", "Goodbye"],
      "responses": ["Goodbye!", "See you later!", "Have a great day!"]
    }
  ]
}
🔮 Future Improvements
Integrating external APIs to provide more complex and dynamic responses.
Enhancing the NLP model for better natural language understanding.
Developing a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI).
